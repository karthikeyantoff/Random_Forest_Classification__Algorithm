📌 About the Project

This project uses a Random Forest classification model trained on a vehicle insurance dataset to predict insurance claim outcomes.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

The Streamlit application provides a simple, interactive interface where users can input vehicle and customer details and instantly receive a prediction result.

The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
